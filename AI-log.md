## Initial Project Request

first u have to write only the github about for my project contail 350
char, Option 3 -- Study Session Planner Assistant Design an assistant
that converts a short-term academic goal into a concrete study schedule
over the next 1--2 weeks. The user specifies what they need to prepare
for (such as an exam or project milestone), which topics are involved,
and what time slots they have available each day. The system should then
generate a simple plan that assigns topics to specific days and
sessions, balancing the workload and ensuring at least some revision
time for more difficult topics. The focus is on turning vague intentions
into an actionable schedule a student can realistically follow. Keep
University students in mind of any discipline.
